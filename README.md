The average American throws away about 70 pounds of clothing each year. The fashion industry is responsible for 10% of global CO2 emissions each year. Researchers project that by 2050, the fashion industry will use up a quarter of the world’s carbon budget.

We often buy clothing that's only worn once before we move on to the next thing. It's wasteful and counterproductive when it comes to addressing the most pressing problem of our generation: climate change.

What's more is that fast fashion — low-cost, rapidly produced clothing — isn't just environmentally harmful. It also exploits cheap labor in sweatshops around the world.

That's where Sustainably Yours comes in. Sustainably Yours is a full-stack web app built using MongoDB, Express, React, and Node.js, and it's a way to fight back at fast fashion.

Sustainably Yours handles user authentication with JSON Web Tokens, adding new users to a database in MongoDB Atlas when they sign up on the site. Once users sign up, they can put clothing they no longer wear on sale, so it can find a second owner. Users can also browse the clothing that other sellers have posted. With Sustainably Yours, users can avoid wastefully throwing away clothing, or shopping from fast fashion retailers more than necessary.

Furthermore, Sustainably Yours is integrated with the Twilio SMS API and the Gmail API through OAuth 2.0 authentication, so to contact a seller, a user can just log in to Sustainably Yours with Google and send an email or text straight from the Sustainably Yours web app.
